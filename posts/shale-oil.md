<br></br>## STEP 1: PREPARING THE RIG SITE

The aboveground infrastructure—pads and access roads—are built, setting up the land for the next step: drilling. From start to finish, everything from traffic plans and designated access roads to noise barriers and safety procedures is carefully planned and monitored according to state and local laws.

<br></br>## STEP 2: DRILLING

First the drill rig is brought to the location—maybe 20 or 30 truck loads—and put together. Now It’s time to build the infrastructure necessary to unlock the oil and natural gas trapped more than a mile below the ground. A well is drilled straight down into the ground beneath the pad. The first stage is to drill what is called the surface hole down to a depth of 100 feet below the deepest known aquifer. A steel casing is then cemented in place so there is no risk of polluting precious water aquifers.

<br></br>## STEP 3: CEMENTING AND TESTING

Once the target distance is reached, the drill pipe is removed and steel pipe is pushed to the bottom. This “well casing” is cemented in place. Rigorous tests are performed to ensure the pipe is impermeable before any production of natural gas or oil can occur.

<br></br>## STEP 4: WELL COMPLETION

Before drillers can tap the oil and natural gas, a perforating gun is typically lowered into the ground and fired into the rock layer in the deepest part of the well, creating holes that connect the rock holding the oil and natural gas and the wellhead.

<br></br>## STEP 5: FRACKING

Now that the first stage of the well is open, it’s time to unlock the oil and natural gas that has been trapped in the rock. Using specialized instruments to monitor pressure and data from the well in real time, fracking fluid, which is 99.5% water and sand and 0.5% chemicals, many of which are found in everyday household products, is pumped at high pressure through the perforating holes to create paper-thin cracks in the shale rock, freeing the oil and natural gas trapped inside.

The cycles of steps 4 and 5 are repeated, gradually working up the hole until all the lateral length of the wellbore has been fracked. This might be 20 or 30 times—but a process that typically takes only a few days to finish.

<br></br>## STEP 6: PRODUCTION AND FRACKING FLUID RECYCLING

Once fracking is completed, production begins. Oil and natural gas flows up from the well bore and fracturing fluid is then recovered and recycled and used in other fracking operations.
